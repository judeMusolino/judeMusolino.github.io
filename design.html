        title="Assorted Web Components"
        para="This web page contains a variety of web components I worked on throughout the semester. The first is an element that allows the user to add users to the system and save them as their 'party', visualized as characters that correspond to the usernames the user enters. This would be utilized on the hax.psu.edu website to share web pages with other users. The second is a counter that lets the user add or subtract numbers to it. The code has a minimum, a maximum, and a starting number, with the color of the number changing on the maximum, the minimum, and the number 18 and confetti on 21. The third web component is a simple card that contains an image, a title, a header, a button link to an external site, and a description box/ details tag. When the details tag is open (default), the card has a property 'fancy' that adds an outline and box shadow to the card."

        title="Image Gallery Project"
        para="The goal of the project was to create an image gallery feature that would allow the user to click on any of the paragraph-separated images on the page and open up a more zoomed-in version of the image with a longer description of the image. This view also has arrows on either side to navigate to the other images, a number showing what slide of the image gallery the user is on (ex. 2 of 4), and an X to close the dialog. A couple of key features of this are hover states for the images that make the image 'pop' off the page, and the use of a Singleton design pattern to manage the content in the body and listen for the media-image tags in the content. The focus of the project was functionality, rather than design. "
